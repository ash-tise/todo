# TODO CLI APPLICATION

Hello all,

This is my first public repository. Here I've created a little todo program written in Golang.
I know that there's a lot of work that needs to be done, but this was a great learning experience. 
I learned new technologies such as golang, sqlite3, as well as how to create a basic CLI application.
