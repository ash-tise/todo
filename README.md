# TODO CLI APPLICATION

## Intro

Hello all,

This is my first public repository. Here I've created a little todo program written in Golang.
I know that there's a lot of work that needs to be done, but this was a great learning experience. 
I learned new technologies such as golang, sqlite3, as well as how to create a basic CLI application.

## Installation

Clone the repository with
``` git clone https://github.com/ash-tise/todo.git ```

Navigate to your new local repository and use ``` go build . ``` to build the todo executable.
You can store it wherever youd like, but I'd recommend storing it with your GO binaries and having it in your path for ease of use.

To build your todo executable and store it with your other go binaries, you can do this with ``` go build -o ~/go/bin/ ``` instead of the previous command above.

Enjoy!
